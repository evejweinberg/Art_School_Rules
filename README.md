# Art_School_Rules

This is an Openframeworks project created while studying at SFPC.io
On the first day of this 10-week immersive program, we were given '10 Rules of Art School' - often attributed to John Cage, but actually they were written by Sister Corita Kent, inspired by John Cage.

Here's what it looks like: https://vimeo.com/127978840

I created a 10-scene application that takes the viewer through 10 interactive metaphors, explaining the 10 rules. 

Enjoy!
